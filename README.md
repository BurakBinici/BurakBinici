### 🎨 Fun Project Showcase

Here's a fun project I've been working on:

The team has participated in the TEKNOFEST Unmanned Underwater Systems competition every year since 2020. The aim of the Ege ROV team is to produce an autonomous underwater vehicle that can be used for various purposes in underwater research, challenging missions, military and civilian applications. .
